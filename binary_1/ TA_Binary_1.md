 "There are only 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary, and those who don't."

* антропологичтость/зоологичность dec numbering system
* why binary
* 10 -> binary algorithm
* add div/sub; fix arg printing
TODO:
* dec -> bin/hex (and back) 
    * (111..11 meaning)
    * (is power of 2 check)
* binary add/mul (by module)
* two's-complement
    * reason --> want sum of opposite to be 0
* 2**10 approx 1000
* min/max
 
* Bin with Fixed Point

(abs min/max? --> answer)
* IEEE 754
* все ли можно представить
* Prepare examples of conversion (write down solns)
 
HW: explanation, sort--> think first!
